The lyrics of "Hotel California"

That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain
Please bring me my wine
He said
We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
They living it up at the Hotel California
What nice surprise
What nice surprise
Bring your alibis
Mirrors on the ceiling
Pink champagne on ice
She said
We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device
In the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stabbed it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember
I was running for the door
I had to find the passage Back
